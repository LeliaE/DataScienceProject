# DataScienceProject

## Topic
This project aims to compare the node distances generated by a connectome-based graph network and real measured between-area distances in the marmoset brain. The goal is to establish similarities between the marmoset brain and a marmoset brain-based graph network in order to asses the feasibility of using networks in brain research.  The assumption is that brain areas with stronger connections will wire close together in the network graph, and therefore network distances should be comparable to brain distances.

## Data
The data and insigtful injection images are taken from https://marmosetbrainmapping.org/ and https://www.marmosetbrain.org/.

Due to transparent format of the figures I advise against using darkmode.
